how to test requests properly (ideally).

Replaced with a check that HOME folder exists.

Added bibmanager.__version__ as second element of pickled file
in bib_manager.save().

Added update_content() method to Bib() object.
This method updates the attributes that are defined by a bibtex entry
and updates any extra info only if the new data is not None.
Added tests.

Added pdf and freeze attributes to Bib() object.  The info for these
attributes is not defined by the bibtex file.  Thus it has to be set
by the user, and such info is stored in the BM pickle database rather
than the BM bibtex database.
For now, these are just a placeholder (more on these soon).

Modified filter_field() and merge() functions to preserve non-bitex
information when updating/merging a new list of entries into the
database.


*****  Thu Dec 26 21:10:38 CLT 2019  *****

Channeled bm.edit() through merge(), now all database editing calls

merge() function; therefore, going through the update_content()
calls that preserve/update the meta info.

located at home/pdf/

Refactored u.BM_DATABASE, u.BM_BIBFILE, u.BM_TMP_BIB, u.BM_CACHE,
u.BM_HISTORY_SEARCH, and u.BM_HISTORY_ADS from constants into
functions that return the file path, but now evaluate home at
